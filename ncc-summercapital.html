				<h1 class="title">NCC #SummerCapital Campaign<br><span>Web Animation</span></h1>
				<p>The National Capital Commission (NCC) is one of the city’s major partners in maintained public spaces and outdoor activities. During the global pandemic, it was of great importance to the NCC to create more public space for safe physical distancing and to promote outdoor activities for people’s physical and mental well-being.</p>

				<p>After a long winter, the NCC decided to run an online campaign that highlighted the activities visitors could safely enjoy on NCC land. The goal was to create interest and engagement through animated ads, something the NCC has never done before.</p>

				<p>This campaign included animated Google and Facebook ads, as well as social media posts on Twitter and Instagram to create intrigue while informing local audiences of NCC’s assets.</p>

				<p>Design features include: animated location markers with activity icons, a silhouetted Ottawa landscape in the background, as well as lots of green space and trees representing NCC parks and outdoor spaces.</p>
