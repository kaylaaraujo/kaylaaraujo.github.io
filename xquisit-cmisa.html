				<h1 class="title">The Canadian Marine Industries and Shipbuilding Association<br><span>Branding</span></h1>
				<p>The Canadian Marine Industries and Shipbuilding Association (CMISA) is a national, not-for-profit organization that drives and promotes innovation, strategic partnerships, and advocacy and advancement of their industry across the country.</p>

				<p>In order to solidify their presence in this growing commercial business, CMISA needed a new corporate identity that would serve their needs and reflect their mandate.</p>

				<p>This logo is comprised of four elements: a ship; Polaris – the North Star; the Canadian maple leaf; and waves forming the wake. Because the marine sector is a diverse industry, I created a simplified ship silhouette that was designed to be inclusive of all marine vessels such as coast guards, ferries, and commercial, research and military ships.</p>

				<p>I included Polaris to honour the history of seafaring when early navigators used the star – an unmoving landmark in the sky – to direct them across the seas. It also serves as a symbol of the way members will confidently navigate the industry, knowing that CMISA is there to guide and assist.</p>

				<p>The mounting waves add dimension and represent the opportunity to build, support, sustain and shape the thriving and developing marine and shipbuilding industry.</p>

				<p>Finally, the maple leaf was a clear choice to represent the significant benefit the marine industry brings to the country’s economy and decidedly communicate the organization's jurisdiction. We employed it using negative space to create a backdrop for the ship illustration.</p>
